          Fizzgigs are creatures from the legendary fantasy movie,
          <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083791/">The Dark Crystal</a>.
          They are small mammalian creatures native to the Endless Forest. Fur
          covers their small paws, which are used for walking short distances,
          but if they need to move quick or travel far they will curl up into a
          ball and roll. Despite their cute exterior, Fizzgigs are ferocious predators, having one of the largest bite radii among the animals of Thra. When working in packs, Fizzgigs could bring down animals many times larger than them.
